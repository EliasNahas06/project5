# Project 5 Documentation 
## Create Multiple different files 
Start by creating the files that you need according to the instructions. (horses, race and track, and main)
## horses.h
### define
Define the horses. 
### Class Horse 
Write a class that consists of a private variable that helps track where the horse is located on the track, or how far it has gone. 

Continue the class this time using public variables. Write the constructor which will be the horse, and then add functions to the constructor to define things like movement, and where the horse is located on the track.

Make sure end the header too. (probably with #endif)

## horses.cpp
### include
Make sure to Include the horses.h file. This file corresponds to it. 

You also need to make sure for both of the cpp files to be using the cstdlib library. 
In this file, you will end up writing logic for the horses.

Write constructor logic that sets the horse's position at the beginning. something like position = 0

Write logic for the movement of the horses. Have the code generate a random number. From that, if it's an odd number, have the code incrament the horses position by one. 

You also should write logic for reporting the positions. use a return statement to return the position if it is called. 

## raceandtrack.h
## raceandtrack.cpp
